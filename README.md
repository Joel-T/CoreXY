## Overview
The design intent with the Belted Core XY was to create a robust motion platform that can be configured for a number of applications such as 3D printing, light milling, plotting, and laser etching. For the most part it was designed with 3D printing and light milling operations in mind. I plan to completely remodel the Belted Core XY in Fusion when I get the chance so that I can offer more than a step file.
### 3D printer Design Intent:
1. Core XY Kinematics
2. Rigid Frame
3. Ability to convert to mill for light milling capability
4. Linear rails 
5. Belted bed
6. Z-Stepper w/ brake
7. Aluminum for all major parts of the motion platform
8. Swappable Bed for 3D printing or milling
9. 300mm^2 build plate 
10. 120v AC bed heater
