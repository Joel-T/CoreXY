## Configuration for Duet
This section will cover the initial configuration of the Duet controller for the printer, for problems and tuning go [here](Documentation/Issues.md) and for setting up a new Duet [here](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Guide/1.+Getting+Connected+to+your+Duet/7).

To start we use the [RepRap Config Tool](https://configurator.reprapfirmware.org/Start) to generate the initial configuration file. 



1. First start by selecting the custom configuration option and click next.
2. On this page enable the Read config-override.g option and make sure to select the CoreXY Geometry option. For the axis min and max see the following table: 

| Axis  | Position |
| :--:  | :------: |
| X Min |    0     |
| X Max |   330    |
| Y Min |   -40    |
| Y Max |   400    |
| Z Min |    0     |
| Z Max |   550    |

3. On the following page the steppers are configured. The direction is dependent of how you plug the steppers into the Duet so for now just leave them all as Forwards, this can be changed anytime from the web interface or by reversing the plug on the steppers. Note: never insert or remove a stepper while the Duet is powered or you risk frying the driver! For this section I am going to assume 1.8* steppers for the X, Y, and Z, a 0.9* stepper for the E, and x16 microstepping interpolated to x256. The settings are as follows:

| Drive | Steps per mm | Max Speed Change (mm/s) | Max Speed (mm/s) | Acceleration (mm/s<sup>2</sup>) | Motor Current (mA) | Motor Driver |
| :---: | :----------: | :---------------------: | :--------------: | :-----------------------------: | :----------------: | :----------: |
|   X   |     80       |            10           |        250       |               500               |        1200        |     0 (X)    |
|   Y   |     80       |            10           |        250       |               500               |        1200        |     1 (Y)    |
|   Z   |     100      |            0.2          |        10        |               20                |        1800        |     2 (Z)    |
|   E   |     837      |            2            |        20        |               250               |        1000        |     3 (E0)   |

4. The Z-Probe uses the nozzle itself as the contact there is no X or Y offset so that can be left at 0 mm. For the probe type select the "Smart Effector or Piezo" and set the trigger height to -0.2 mm. This value is how you tune your first layer and like all other settings this can be adjusted later through the web interface. Make sure that it is set as a negative value or after probing your hotend **WILL** crash into the bed. I set the Trigger value to 800 so that if the piezo disk has some pressure on it or there is some electrical interference the probe isn't falsely triggered. Recovery time can be left at 0.4 seconds. The Homing Preferences can also be left at their defaults. Endstop configuration is a pretty straight forward affair. A left-front origin is used and the configuration is as follows:

| Axis | Endstop Type | Endstop Location |
| :--: | :----------: | :--------------: |
|   X  |  Active high |    At low end    |
|   Y  |  Active high |    At low end    |
|   Z  |    Z-Probe   |    At low end    |


5. The heater settings are simple even with the bed heater being controlled by a SSR. Make sure for the General settings that "Heated Bed" is checked and set to Bang-Bang for control method. For the rest of the heater configuration it is as follows:

| Heater | Type | Temp. Limit | PWM Limit | R25 | Î² | C | Sensor Channel |
| :----: | :--: | :---------: | :-------: | :-: | :-:| :-: | :---------: |
|  Bed   | Heated Bed | 175 | N/A | 100000 | 3950 | 0 | Bed Thermistor   |
|   E0   | Nozzle | 400 | 100 | N/A | N/A | N/A | MAX31856 on CS1        |

6. On the next page the mesh bed compensation is set up. The print head has a workspace that exceeds the size of the bed so it is important when setting up the mesh leveling that you ensure the probing points are on the bed. For this printer it is as follows:

| X Min | X Max | Y Min | Y Max | Grid Spacing |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :----------: |
|  15   |  295  |  15   |  295  |      20      |

7. On this page you can name the printer as you see fit and you can also set up the wifi info now to connect to the network that the printer will be on. I advise that after the Duet is setup and configured to go into your router and assign the Duet a fixed IP so that you can easily make a bookmark to the web interface.
8. For the final page we will be configuring the cooling fans and the z axis brake. There should be three fans, 0, 1, and 2, if there isn't just click the add fan button in the upper right. Fan 0 will be the part cooling fan, fan 1 the hotend fan, and fan 2 the brake. This is set up as such:

| Name | Value | Inverted | Frequency | Thermostatic Control | Monitored Heaters | Thermostatic Mode Trigger Temp. |
| :--: | :---: | :------: | :-------: | :------------------: | :---------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| Fan0 |   0   |    No    |    500    |           No         |         N/A       |                 N/A             |
| Fan1 |  100  |    No    |    500    |          Yes         |         E0        |                 45              |
| Fan2 |   0   |    No    |    500    |           No         |         N/A       |                 N/A             |

9. Finally click finish and download the bundle as a zip file.
